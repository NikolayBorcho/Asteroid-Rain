Hello! Thank you for your interest in my work!

This project should be straightforward to compile. 
The AsteroidRain folder contains a Visual Studio Express 2012 solution.
The Executable folder contains the application itself compiled in release mode.
All needed libraries are provided within the lib forlder of the project.
In order for the audio component to run the openal32.dll (provided in the dll folder) must be in the same directory as the executable.
